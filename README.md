# Image Classification Web App using Flask and TensorFlow

This project implements a web application that classifies images using a deep learning model trained on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The app allows users to upload an image, and it predicts the class of the image using a **TensorFlow** model served by a **Flask** web server.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Upload images to be classified.
- **Prediction**: The model predicts the class of the uploaded image (e.g., Airplane, Dog, Horse, etc.).
- **Web Interface**: Simple and responsive Flask-based interface.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Pre-trained CNN model using TensorFlow, based on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Flask**: For creating the web application and handling user interactions.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the front-end design.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-app.git
   cd image-classification-app

2. **Install required dependencies: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

3.
