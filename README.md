# image-classification-project
A Flask web app that classifies images using a TensorFlow model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Users upload an image, and the model predicts its class (e.g., Airplane, Dog, Horse). The app uses Flask for the backend, TensorFlow for the model, and HTML/CSS for the user interface.
